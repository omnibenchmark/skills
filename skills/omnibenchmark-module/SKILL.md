description: "Take an Omnibenchmark module from the `ob create module` scaffold to something that actually runs under a benchmark plan: scaffolding against a stage so the entrypoint's CLI is generated for you, replacing the single `default` entrypoint with named ones, adding envs/ + pixi.toml + LICENSE, fixing the CITATION.cff CHANGE_ME placeholders, writing the stage-contract invariants down as checks, running the module locally with `ob run -m`, and wiring GitHub CI. Use when asked to create a new module, add a stage or entrypoint to an existing one, make a scaffolded module runnable, or work out why a module fails under `ob run`. Also use before writing any module code, to decide with the author which stage, language and outputs are in scope."

# From scaffold to a module that runs

A module is a small repository that implements one or more **stages** of a plan.
Its whole job: accept the flags the stage declares, call the tool, write the
declared output files. A good wrapper module is a few dozen lines. If your draft
is growing past that, the design is wrong — stop and say so instead of writing
more.

You are an aide to the module author, not a code generator. Teach the commands
with their flags; never hide `ob` or `pixi` behind a wrapper script. If you
cannot explain in one sentence why a line exists, delete the line.

## 0. Ask before you generate

These answers change the scaffold command itself, so get them first. Ask as
either/or, not open-ended:

1. **Which plan and which stage?** You need the plan YAML (path or URL) and the
   stage `id` exactly as it appears under `stages:`. Without them the scaffold
   cannot generate the CLI.
2. **Which language?** `run.py`, `run.R` or `run.sh` — that is the whole choice
   list. Pick the language the upstream tool is written in.
3. **One stage or several?** Land the first one before adding a second (§5).
4. **Which upstream function is "the method"?** Name it. A wrapper that calls
   two functions is usually two modules.
5. **Which knobs become plan `parameters` and which are hard-coded?** Anything
   the benchmark is comparing is a parameter; everything else is a constant in
   the code with a comment saying why.
6. **What exactly goes in each declared output file?** Columns, row order, index
   column, dtype. This is the contract, and it is what §6 asserts.
7. **What should happen on degenerate input** (zero cells after filtering,
   fewer features than requested components)? Fail loudly, or emit an empty
   file? There is no default worth guessing.

## 1. Scaffold against the stage — never bare

```bash
ob create module pca-mytool \
  --benchmark ../split-stages-plan/benchmark_conda.yaml \
  --for-stage PCA \
  --non-interactive \
  --name pca-mytool \
  --author-name "Jane Doe" \
  --author-email jane@example.org \
  --description "PCA via mytool" \
  --license MIT \
  --entrypoint run.py
```

| flag | why you care |
| --- | --- |
| `PATH` (first argument) | directory to create; `ob` git-inits it and makes an initial commit |
| `--benchmark` | plan YAML, path or URL. **Must** be given together with `--for-stage` — either one alone exits 1 |
| `--for-stage` | stage `id` from the plan. This is what generates one CLI flag per stage input |
| `--non-interactive` | skip the copier prompts; then `--name`, `--author-name`, `--author-email` are all required |
| `--license` | one of `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `GPL-3.0-or-later`, `BSD-3-Clause`, `CC0-1.0`. Writes the SPDX id into `CITATION.cff` — **not** a LICENSE file (§3) |
| `--entrypoint` | `run.py` \| `run.R` \| `run.sh` |

Scaffolding **without** `--benchmark/--for-stage` is the common mistake: you get
a placeholder comment where the stage inputs should be, and you then hand-write
flags that drift from the plan. Always pass the stage.

`ob create module` also prints, when `--benchmark` is a local file, a YAML
snippet to paste under that stage's `modules:`. It does not edit the plan (§8).

## 2. The generated CLI *is* the stage contract

For a stage declaring `inputs: [normalized_selected_h5]`, the generated `run.py`
contains exactly this — nothing else about it is interesting:

```python
    # Required by OmniBenchmark
    parser.add_argument('--output_dir', type=str, required=True, ...)
    parser.add_argument('--name', type=str, required=True, ...)
    # Stage-specific inputs
    parser.add_argument('--normalized_selected_h5', nargs='+', dest='normalized_selected_h5',
                        required=True, help='Input: normalized_selected_h5')
```

Four things to know, and they bite in this order:

- `--output_dir` and `--name` are always passed by Omnibenchmark and must not
  be declared as plan parameters. Per spec §3.5, **`--name` is the module id of
  the current execution**. Write your files into `--output_dir` with the
  filenames the stage's output `path:` template resolves to — so
  `path: "{name}_embedding.tsv"` means `f"{args.name}_embedding.tsv"`, and a
  `{dataset}_…` template means the *initial* stage's module id, which `--name`
  does **not** give you outside the initial stage. (Under api ≤ 0.4 the backend
  passes the dataset as `--name` as a documented workaround, which is why the
  legacy exemplars write `{name}_…` against `{dataset}_…` templates. That
  workaround is marked for removal.) If a plan's template and the filename your
  module writes disagree, the run fails on a missing output — settle this with
  the plan author before writing the writer.
- **Every input flag is `nargs='+'`, so `args.x` is a list even for one file.**
  A single-file input arrives as `['path']`. Index it (`args.x[0]`) or iterate;
  passing the list to a reader is the most common first-run crash.
- Input ids containing dots keep the dot in the flag and get underscores in the
  destination: `data.raw` → `--data.raw`, `args.data_raw`.
- The flag names come from the plan's `inputs:` ids. If the plan changes them,
  re-run `ob create module` into a scratch directory and diff the parser rather
  than editing flags by hand.

R and shell scaffolds carry the same contract (`argparse` `ArgumentParser` with
`nargs="+"`; bash arrays with uppercased variable names).

## 3. Close the gaps the scaffold leaves

The scaffold is not a production module. These are the differences, all of them
verified against a freshly generated module:

| gap | what to do |
| --- | --- |
| `env/` (singular, empty) — and the emitted `.gitignore` ignores `env/`, so even its `.gitkeep` is never committed | delete it; use `envs/<name>.yml` (§4) |
| no `LICENSE` file, though the help text claims a LICENSE check | add the full license text matching the SPDX id in `CITATION.cff` |
| no `pixi.toml` | see §4 |
| `entrypoints: {default: run.py}` | replace with named entrypoints, one per stage served (§7) |
| `CITATION.cff` has `https://github.com/CHANGE_ME/<module>` in `url` and `repository-code`; a one-word `--author-name` yields `family-names: "Ben"`, `given-names: ""` | fix both by hand before the first push |
| no CI workflow | §9 |

**`ob validate module` passes on the untouched scaffold — plain and with
`--strict`, exit 0 both times.** It is a metadata check, not evidence that the
module is right. Treat a green validate as "nothing structural is missing", and
see the `omnibenchmark-validate` skill for what it does and does not look at.

## 4. Environment: one line here, detail elsewhere

A module needs a `pixi.toml` and an exported `envs/<name>.yml` — the conda YAML
is what a plan's `software_environments` entry ultimately consumes. Generate it
with `pixi run export-env`; never hand-edit the export.

Authoring the `pixi.toml`, pinning, and harmonising dependency constraints
across modules belong to the **`omnibenchmark-packaging`** skill. Do not
re-derive them here.

## 5. One increment at a time

Small, complete, reviewable increments beat a long branch:

- **Land one working entrypoint before adding the second.** A module that serves
  one stage correctly is mergeable; a half-finished module serving four is not.
- Keep each diff small enough that a biologist can review it in one sitting.
- Say what the *next* increment will be rather than doing it in the same change.
- Prefer editing the generated scaffold in place over replacing it — the diff is
  the unit of review.

## 6. Write the invariants down

Two different checks, both cheap, both worth it:

**Environment check** — the `check` task in the exemplar modules is an import
smoke test and nothing more (`python check.py` imports the runtime packages and
prints `OK`; `Rscript check.R` loads the libraries and prints `OK`). Run it
after `pixi install` to confirm the environment resolved.

**Contract invariants** — the assertions that earn their place encode the stage
contract, because they are what a reviewer cannot check by eye:

```python
emb = ...                                   # cells x components
assert emb.shape[0] == adata.n_obs, (emb.shape, adata.n_obs)   # no cells lost
assert emb.shape[1] == args.n_components                        # requested width
assert list(cell_ids) == list(adata.obs_names)                  # identifiers survive
```

```r
stopifnot(nrow(embedding) == ncol(m))          # one row per cell
stopifnot(!anyNA(embedding))
```

Put them next to the code they guard, or in `check.{py,R}` when they need the
written file. Degenerate cases the author named in §0 get one assertion each.

This is not a licence to generate a test suite nobody asked for. A test that
encodes an invariant the author named is documentation; a test asserting that a
function returns what it just returned is noise. No defensive `try/except`
blankets, no logging framework, no docstrings on trivial functions.

## 7. Name the entrypoints

The plan binds a module by entrypoint name:

```yaml
        repository:
          url: https://github.com/<org>/<module>
          commit: b41bf43
          entrypoint: pca
```

so `omnibenchmark.yaml` must have that key:

```yaml
entrypoints:
  default: pca.py   # keep this: alias for the primary entrypoint
  pca: pca.py
  knn: knn.py
```

An entrypoint value may carry a prefix command (the exemplars use
`pca-prof: prof.sh pca.py` for a profiled variant).

**Always keep a `default:` alias pointing at the module's primary entrypoint.**
Without it `ob validate module` warns `omnibenchmark.yaml 'entrypoints' is
missing required 'default' key`, and `--strict` turns that warning into a
failure — exit 1, measured on `scanpy`, `5-pca-irlba-r` and `metrics`. Adding
the alias takes the same module to exit 0 (verified), which is what makes
`--strict` usable in CI at all. It costs one duplicated line and buys a CI
signal that would otherwise have to stay off.

This is a workaround for a validator that assumes every module has one
entrypoint, not a design statement: the alias duplicates whichever named
entrypoint you consider primary. Revisit it if the upstream check learns about
named entrypoints.

## 8. Register the module in the plan

Paste the snippet `ob create module` printed under the stage's `modules:`, then
fix what it guessed:

```yaml
  - id: pca-mytool
    name: PCA via mytool
    software_environment: scanpy      # inferred from sibling modules — check it
    repository:
      url: /local/path/to/pca-mytool  # replace with the public URL
      commit: ""                      # pin a commit before merging
      entrypoint: pca                 # add this: the snippet omits it
```

The snippet is emitted only for a local plan file, `software_environment` is
inferred from the other modules in that stage (it says so when it has to guess),
and `commit: ""` plus a local `url:` only work with `ob run --dirty`. Plan-side
editing is the `omnibenchmark-plan` skill's territory.

## 9. Run it, three ways, in this order

```bash
# 1. Directly — fastest loop, and it teaches the author the contract
pixi run python pca.py --output_dir out --name smoke \
  --normalized_selected_h5 /path/to/input.h5 --n_components 10 --random_seed 42

# 2. Under the plan, module-scoped dev run
ob run ../split-stages-plan/benchmark_conda.yaml -m pca-mytool --dirty --cores 4
```

`-m/--module` prunes every stage after the target module's stage and keeps only
the first upstream input × parameter expansion, so it is a fast smoke test, not
a benchmark. `--dirty` allows local-path module references with uncommitted
changes (development only); `--unpinned` does the same for branch refs on remote
repos; `-d/--dry` generates the Snakefile without executing; `--out-dir` moves
the default `out/`.

Third: run the plan's own output validators against what you produced, before
you push. See `references/ci-and-plan-validators.md`.

## Pitfalls

- Treating a green `ob validate module` as correctness. It is metadata only.
- Forgetting `nargs='+'` and handing a one-element list to a file reader.
- Keeping `entrypoints: default:` *and* adding named ones, then wondering which
  the plan used — the plan uses the name in `repository.entrypoint`.
- Writing an output filename that does not match the stage's `path:` template
  (see §2) — the job fails on a missing output, not on anything your code did.
- Copying a module's plan-facing metadata from the omni-scrna exemplars: those
  repos are on `api_version: "0.4.0"` (§ exemplars below).
